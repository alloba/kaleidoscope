This is the frontend application for the kaleidoscope project that I've set up. 
Written in Angular. 

This is meant to pair with the backend service for the overall application, which this uses to pull data from. 

refer to Dockerfile for run information, but it's hoenstly a pretty standard bit of code as far as an Angular 
application is concerned.
